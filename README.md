# Dev.to Analytics

The purpose of this set of small scripts is to get some insights of your most popular articles and tags posted on [dev.to](https://dev.to/).

Its usage is very simple. You obviously need an account on [dev.to](https://dev.to/) and post some articles, if you read this, most probably you have already done this.

Then the next steps are:
* Go your [account settings](https://dev.to/settings/account) and generate a new API key. The description doesn't really matter, but DevToAnalytics should be just fine.
* Copy the just generated active API Key
* Clone this project
* Run `analyzer.py --api-key <YOUR API KEY>`
* Read the output and get some insights
